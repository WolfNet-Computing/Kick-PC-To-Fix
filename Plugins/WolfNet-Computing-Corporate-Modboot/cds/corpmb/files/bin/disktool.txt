DISKTOOL, (C) 1999-2000, Bart Lagerweij.

What does it do?
----------------

It performs various tests on all kind of harddisks, ATAPI/SCSI/RAID/... as
long as the drive is under BIOS control (INT13/INT13 extensions).
The test functions are:
  - Seek test
  - Quick read
  - Random read
  - Full read
  - Random write/compare*
  - Full write/compare*
  - Logical block address test*
  - Full erase*
  - Spindle speed

WARNING: the test functions marked by "*" are destructive, they overwrite data
         on your disk.

You can create/customize your own test-maps, and run whatever test functions
you want. These test-maps can also be started by command-line parameters.

For example, to start a test you've created called "mytest" for 3 loops on your
first fixed disk, you should run "disktool -l=3 -s=80 mytest".

Is DISKTOOL freeware?
---------------------
Yes, DISKTOOL is freeware!

What platforms are supported?
-----------------------------

DISKTOOL runs best in plane Dos. It will run in Windows 9x, but things get
slowed down, best thing is to run it in Dos. You can very easily create a
bootable floppy diskette, and run disktool from it.

How do I install it?
--------------------

You don't install it. Just boot Dos (not windows) and run DISKTOOL.EXE
