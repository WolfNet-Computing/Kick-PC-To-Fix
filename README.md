# WolfNet-Boot-CD-Builder

Simply add files to a subfdolder of cds, run bcd.cmd from a command line (with the appropriate switches) and off you go. Examples are included as subfolders. cdrommi is a multiboot cd image and cdromsi is a single boot image. If you don't know which type you need then remember, for one OS it's single boot. If you want multiple bootable entries it's multiboot.
