# DISCLAIMER!  
  
This is essential reading, Do not skip!  
  
## DO NOT LITERALLY KICK YOUR COMPUTER WHEN FIXING IT!  
  
 This is because you will obviously break it even more. The word "kick" in the name is wordplay as the term for loading the Operating System your PC runs on is "booting the system".
